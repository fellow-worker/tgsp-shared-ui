The minium required for a text field is to provide a label
```jsx
    <TextField label="Username" />
```

Using the password type, it becomes a password box
```jsx
    <TextField label="Password" type="password" />
```

As with the input, the color can be changed
```jsx
    <TextField color="secondary" label="Password" type="password" />
```
